# Project Roadmap: CMMC Compliance Tracker

This document outlines the planned phases and tasks for the CMMC Compliance Tracker project, based on the review conducted on 2025-04-04.

## Phase 1: Stabilization and Known Issues (Immediate Priority)

This phase focuses on addressing critical issues identified in `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` before moving to new features.

### Goal 1: Address Critical Security Refinements
*   **Task 1.1:** Review and refine Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
*   **Task 1.2:** Review and tune Rate Limiting configuration.
*   **Task 1.3:** Conduct targeted review for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and apply fixes.

### Goal 2: Address High-Priority Performance Issues
*   **Task 2.1:** Investigate and resolve timeouts during large evidence uploads.
*   **Task 2.2:** Profile and optimize dashboard loading performance.
*   **Task 2.3:** Investigate and optimize large audit log queries.
*   **Task 2.4:** Monitor and potentially tune database connection pool parameters.
*   **Task 2.5:** ✅ Enhance database connection handling for Docker container name resolution in testing environments.

### Goal 3: Address Authentication Issues
*   **Task 3.1:** Investigate and fix inconsistent session timeout handling.
*   **Task 3.2:** Review and address potential TOTP validation issues related to clock synchronization.

### Goal 4: Enhance Testing Framework
*   **Task 4.1:** ✅ Document testing strategy and best practices in `memory-bank/testingStrategy.md`.
*   **Task 4.2:** ✅ Update test fixtures to handle Docker container name resolution.
*   **Task 4.3:** Improve test coverage for core functionality.
*   **Task 4.4:** Add performance tests for critical operations.
*   **Task 4.5:** Implement continuous integration for automated testing.

### Goal 5: Address Other Known Issues (Lower Priority within Phase 1)
*   **Task 5.1:** Investigate and fix known UI/UX issues (responsiveness, form validation, navigation, accessibility).
*   **Task 5.2:** Improve email notification reliability and customization options.

## Phase 2: Implement Core "In Progress" Features (After Phase 1)

Once the application is stabilized, development can focus on the features listed as "In Progress" in `progress.md`, prioritized according to stakeholder needs. Key areas include:

*   Advanced Reporting (PDF generation, customization)
*   Bulk Operations (Import/Export, Batch Uploads)
*   API Development (RESTful endpoints)
*   Expanded Settings System (Lifecycle config, email templates)
*   Performance Monitoring (Pool metrics, query analysis)

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Longer Term)

Address features listed under "Not Yet Started" in `progress.md`:

*   Advanced Analytics
*   Integration Capabilities (SSO, external APIs)
*   Mobile Application

## Ongoing Activities

*   Continuous security monitoring and dependency updates.
*   Regular code reviews and refactoring.
*   Optionally address minor code refinements noted in `systemPatterns.md`.
