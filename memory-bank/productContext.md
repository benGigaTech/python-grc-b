# Product Context: CMMC Compliance Tracker

## Problem Space

Organizations seeking Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) face several challenges:

1. **Complex Compliance Requirements**: CMMC incorporates multiple cybersecurity standards and frameworks, creating a complex set of requirements that can be difficult to track and manage.

2. **Evidence Management Challenges**: Organizations must collect and maintain substantial evidence to demonstrate compliance, often resulting in scattered documentation and inconsistent record-keeping.

3. **Resource Constraints**: Many organizations lack dedicated compliance personnel and struggle to allocate responsibilities effectively across teams.

4. **Audit Preparation Difficulties**: Preparing for compliance audits is time-consuming and stressful without proper organization and documentation.

5. **Visibility Limitations**: Leadership often lacks clear visibility into compliance status and progress across the organization.

## Solution Overview

The CMMC Compliance Tracker addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Structured Control Management**: A comprehensive database of CMMC and NIST SP 800-171 controls with clear organization and categorization.

2. **Centralized Evidence Repository**: A secure platform for uploading, storing, and managing all compliance-related evidence with metadata tracking.

3. **Task Assignment and Tracking**: Capability to delegate compliance tasks to appropriate personnel with due dates and status monitoring.

4. **Real-time Dashboard**: Visual representation of compliance status with metrics and reports for stakeholders at all levels.

5. **Audit-Ready Documentation**: Automatic generation of audit trails and compliance documentation to streamline certification processes.
