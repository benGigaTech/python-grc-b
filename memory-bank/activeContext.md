# Active Context: CMMC Compliance Tracker

## Current Work Focus

The CMMC Compliance Tracker project is currently in active development. Based on the repository exploration, the following areas are active:

1. **Core Application Structure**: The basic Flask application structure has been established, including routes, models, and templates.

2. **User Authentication**: Login functionality with password hashing is implemented, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been added with TOTP support and backup codes.

3. **Control Management**: The system supports managing CMMC controls with their associated requirements.

4. **Evidence Management**: Functionality for uploading and managing compliance evidence files is implemented, including status tracking and file metadata.

5. **Dashboard Refinement**: The dashboard has been streamlined to focus on domain-specific compliance metrics rather than trend analysis, with improved layout and responsiveness.

6. **Export Functionality**: Enhanced export capabilities for compliance controls with support for multiple formats (CSV and JSON) to facilitate data sharing and external analysis.

7. **Docker Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose configuration for containerized deployment with PostgreSQL and Redis.

## Recent Changes

1. **Enhanced Reporting Capabilities**:
   - Added JSON export functionality for controls data
   - Improved the CSV export mechanism
   - Created a dropdown menu for different export format options
   - Added consistent styling for export buttons
   - Fixed URL routing issues for export endpoints

2. **Dashboard Simplification**: 
   - Removed the compliance progress trend chart as per stakeholder feedback
   - Fixed layout issues to prevent element overlapping
   - Enhanced the Domain Compliance Overview to use full width
   - Improved the responsiveness of tables with proper overflow handling
   - Added consistent styling for tables and elements

3. **Security Improvements**: Several security enhancements have been implemented:
   - Password strength enforcement
   - HTTP security headers implementation
   - Enhanced password reset security with one-time use tokens
   - IDOR protection improvements with ownership validation
   - Redis-backed rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Multi-factor authentication with TOTP and backup codes
   - Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
   - Admin interface to manage locked accounts

4. **Evidence Management**: Added comprehensive evidence management system with:
   - File upload with type validation
   - Metadata tracking including expiration dates
   - Status indicators (Current, Pending Review, Expired)
   - Secure file download mechanism

5. **Database Migrations**: Added migration framework and scripts to handle schema evolution over time.

6. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented Redis-backed rate limiting for security-sensitive endpoints.

7. **Email Notifications**: Set up automated email notifications for task assignments and approaching deadlines.

## Active Decisions

1. **Reporting Format Support**: Decision to provide multiple data export formats (CSV and JSON) to accommodate different user needs and external system integration requirements.

2. **Dashboard Focus**: Decision to focus on domain-specific compliance metrics rather than historical trend analysis based on user feedback and usability considerations.

3. **Database Technology**: Using SQLite for development with migration path to PostgreSQL for production.

4. **File Storage Strategy**: Storing evidence files in a local filesystem directory with database metadata references.

5. **Authentication Approach**: Using Flask-Login with custom MFA implementation (TOTP) rather than a third-party auth provider.

6. **UI Framework**: Utilizing Bootstrap for responsive design across desktop and mobile devices.

7. **Deployment Strategy**: Containerized deployment with Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

8. **Rate Limiting Backend**: Using Redis for persistent storage of rate limiting data across application restarts.

## Next Steps

1. **Advanced Reporting System**: 
   - Develop PDF report templates for compliance status
   - Create additional customizable export options
   - Implement scheduled report generation and delivery

2. **Bulk Operations**: 
   - Add batch import/export for controls and evidence
   - Implement mass task assignments 
   - Create bulk status update functionality

3. **API Development**:
   - Design RESTful endpoints for programmatic access
   - Implement authentication for API consumers
   - Create comprehensive API documentation

4. **User Management Improvements**: 
   - Enhance user profile management and role-based permissions
   - Add team/group management capabilities
   - Develop more granular access controls

5. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks for larger deployments
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries and indexing

6. **Additional Security Enhancements**: Implement planned security improvements:
   - Advanced input validation
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring
   - Regular security scanning
   - Server hardening measures

## Current Challenges

1. **Evidence Lifecycle Management**: Developing a robust system for tracking evidence validity and expiration.

2. **Notification System Reliability**: Ensuring email notifications are delivered reliably and on schedule.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Considerations**: Evaluating requirements for supporting multiple organizations within the same instance.

4. **Security Hardening**: Ongoing assessment and improvement of application security measures.

5. **UI/UX Refinement**: Enhancing user experience based on initial feedback and usability testing.
