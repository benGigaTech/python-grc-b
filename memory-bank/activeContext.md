# Active Context: CMMC Compliance Tracker

## Current Work Focus

The CMMC Compliance Tracker project is currently in active development. Based on the repository exploration, the following areas are active:

1. **Core Application Structure**: The basic Flask application structure has been established, including routes, models, and templates.

2. **User Authentication**: Login functionality with password hashing is implemented, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been added with TOTP support and backup codes.

3. **Control Management**: The system supports managing CMMC controls with their associated requirements.

4. **Evidence Management**: Functionality for uploading and managing compliance evidence files is implemented, including status tracking and file metadata.

5. **Docker Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose configuration for containerized deployment with PostgreSQL and Redis.

## Recent Changes

1. **Security Improvements**: Several security enhancements have been implemented:
   - Password strength enforcement
   - HTTP security headers implementation
   - Enhanced password reset security with one-time use tokens
   - IDOR protection improvements with ownership validation
   - Redis-backed rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Multi-factor authentication with TOTP and backup codes

2. **Evidence Management**: Added comprehensive evidence management system with:
   - File upload with type validation
   - Metadata tracking including expiration dates
   - Status indicators (Current, Pending Review, Expired)
   - Secure file download mechanism

3. **Database Migrations**: Added migration framework and scripts to handle schema evolution over time.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented Redis-backed rate limiting for security-sensitive endpoints.

5. **Email Notifications**: Set up automated email notifications for task assignments and approaching deadlines.

## Active Decisions

1. **Database Technology**: Using SQLite for development with migration path to PostgreSQL for production.

2. **File Storage Strategy**: Storing evidence files in a local filesystem directory with database metadata references.

3. **Authentication Approach**: Using Flask-Login with custom MFA implementation (TOTP) rather than a third-party auth provider.

4. **UI Framework**: Utilizing Bootstrap for responsive design across desktop and mobile devices.

5. **Deployment Strategy**: Containerized deployment with Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

6. **Rate Limiting Backend**: Using Redis for persistent storage of rate limiting data across application restarts.

## Next Steps

1. **Dashboard Enhancement**: Improve the dashboard with more detailed metrics and visualizations for compliance status.

2. **Advanced Reporting**: Develop additional report templates for different stakeholder needs.

3. **Bulk Import/Export**: Add functionality to import and export controls and evidence in batch operations.

4. **User Management Improvements**: Enhance user profile management and role-based permissions.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks for larger deployments.

6. **API Development**: Create a REST API for programmatic access to the application's functionality.

7. **Additional Security Enhancements**: Implement planned security improvements:
   - Account lockout policy
   - Advanced input validation
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring
   - Regular security scanning
   - Server hardening measures

## Current Challenges

1. **Evidence Lifecycle Management**: Developing a robust system for tracking evidence validity and expiration.

2. **Notification System Reliability**: Ensuring email notifications are delivered reliably and on schedule.

3. **Multi-Tenancy Considerations**: Evaluating requirements for supporting multiple organizations within the same instance.

4. **Security Hardening**: Ongoing assessment and improvement of application security measures.

5. **UI/UX Refinement**: Enhancing user experience based on initial feedback and usability testing.
