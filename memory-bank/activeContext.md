17. **[2025-04-04 12:05:25] Phase 1 Stabilization Progress**: Addressed several items:
    - **CSP Refinement (Task 1.1)**: Refactored static inline styles/scripts & nonces. Fixed calendar JS syntax error. Added missing nonces to style blocks. Consolidated styles into base.html. Temporarily re-added `'unsafe-inline'` to `style-src` as a workaround for persistent `style-src-attr` violation (likely dynamic JS) and related functional issues (calendar render, add evidence theme bug) which require interactive debugging. Task paused.
    - **Rate Limiting (Task 1.2)**: Reviewed configuration. Tuning deferred. Task complete for now.
    - **XSS Review (Task 1.3)**: Reviewed templates for `|safe`, unsafe JS methods, and download headers. Refactored footer year display. Task complete for now.
    - **Upload Timeouts (Task 2.1)**: Increased Gunicorn timeout to 120s in `start.sh`. Further action deferred. Task complete for now.
    - **Dashboard Perf (Task 2.2)**: Optimized domain metrics and status count queries in `controls.py`. Indexing review deferred. Task complete for now.
    - **Audit Log Queries (Task 2.3)**: Reviewed; no large queries found. Indexing recommended. Task complete for now.
    - **Connection Pool (Task 2.4)**: Reviewed configuration. Tuning deferred. Task complete for now.
    - **Session Timeout (Task 3.1)**: Addressed inconsistency by enforcing permanent sessions in `__init__.py`. Task complete.
    - **TOTP Clock Skew (Task 3.2)**: Addressed by increasing validation window to 1 in `mfa.py`. Task complete.

## Active Decisions

1. **Database Connection Management Strategy**: Decision to implement connection pooling with psycopg2's ThreadedConnectionPool to improve performance and scalability under concurrent load, with configurable pool sizes for different deployment scenarios.

2. **Thread-Safe Connection Pool Implementation**: Decision to use thread-local storage and proper locking mechanisms to ensure safe connection management across concurrent threads.

3. **Connection Pool Configuration**: Decision to make pool parameters (min connections, max connections) configurable through environment variables in docker-compose.yml.

4. **Application Configuration Strategy**: Decision to use a database-backed settings service with in-memory caching for performance.

5. **Settings Organization**: Decision to use a hierarchical key structure (app.*, security.*, notification.*) for logical organization and future extensibility.

6. **UI Design for Settings**: Decision to use a tabbed interface with categories to improve usability of the settings page.

7. **Reporting Format Support**: Decision to provide multiple data export formats (CSV and JSON) to accommodate different user needs and external system integration requirements.

8. **Dashboard Focus**: Decision to focus on domain-specific compliance metrics rather than historical trend analysis based on user feedback and usability considerations.

9. **Database Technology**: Using SQLite for development with migration path to PostgreSQL for production.

10. **File Storage Strategy**: Storing evidence files in a local filesystem directory with database metadata references.

11. **Authentication Approach**: Using Flask-Login with custom MFA implementation (TOTP) rather than a third-party auth provider.

12. **UI Framework**: Utilizing Bootstrap for responsive design across desktop and mobile devices.

13. **Deployment Strategy**: Containerized deployment with Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

14. **Rate Limiting Backend**: Using Redis for persistent storage of rate limiting data across application restarts.

## Next Steps

With the migration system, entrypoint logic, file validation, and conditional seeding now working, the next steps in **Phase 1: Stabilization and Known Issues** are:

1.  **Critical Security Refinements:** 
    - Refine Content Security Policy (CSP).
    - Review and tune Rate Limiting configuration.
    - Review for additional XSS protections.
2.  **Address High-Priority Performance Issues:** Investigate and attempt to resolve critical performance bottlenecks like large evidence upload timeouts or slow dashboard loading (`Known Issues > Performance`).
3.  **Authentication Issues:** Address remaining known issues like inconsistent session timeout handling.

Once these stabilization tasks are complete, we can move to **Phase 2: Implement Core "In Progress" Features**.
