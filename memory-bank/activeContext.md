# Active Context: CMMC Compliance Tracker

## Current Work Focus

The CMMC Compliance Tracker project is currently in active development. Based on the repository exploration, the following areas are active:

1. **Core Application Structure**: The basic Flask application structure has been established, including routes, models, and templates.

2. **User Authentication**: Login functionality with password hashing is implemented, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been added with TOTP support and backup codes.

3. **Control Management**: The system supports managing CMMC controls with their associated requirements.

4. **Evidence Management**: Functionality for uploading and managing compliance evidence files is implemented, including status tracking and file metadata.

5. **Dashboard Refinement**: The dashboard has been streamlined to focus on domain-specific compliance metrics rather than trend analysis, with improved layout and responsiveness.

6. **Export Functionality**: Enhanced export capabilities for compliance controls with support for multiple formats (CSV and JSON) to facilitate data sharing and external analysis.

7. **Docker Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose configuration for containerized deployment with PostgreSQL and Redis.

8. **Application Configuration**: Added admin settings page allowing configuration of core application parameters without code changes.

9. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented database connection pooling to improve application scalability and performance under concurrent load.

9. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented Redis-backed rate limiting for security-sensitive endpoints.

10. **Email Notifications**: Set up automated email notifications for task assignments and approaching deadlines.

## Active Decisions

1. **Database Connection Management Strategy**: Decision to implement connection pooling with psycopg2's ThreadedConnectionPool to improve performance and scalability under concurrent load, with configurable pool sizes for different deployment scenarios.

2. **Thread-Safe Connection Pool Implementation**: Decision to use thread-local storage and proper locking mechanisms to ensure safe connection management across concurrent threads.

3. **Connection Pool Configuration**: Decision to make pool parameters (min connections, max connections) configurable through environment variables in docker-compose.yml.

4. **Application Configuration Strategy**: Decision to use a database-backed settings service with in-memory caching for performance.

5. **Settings Organization**: Decision to use a hierarchical key structure (app.*, security.*, notification.*) for logical organization and future extensibility.

6. **UI Design for Settings**: Decision to use a tabbed interface with categories to improve usability of the settings page.

7. **Reporting Format Support**: Decision to provide multiple data export formats (CSV and JSON) to accommodate different user needs and external system integration requirements.

8. **Dashboard Focus**: Decision to focus on domain-specific compliance metrics rather than historical trend analysis based on user feedback and usability considerations.

9. **Database Technology**: Using SQLite for development with migration path to PostgreSQL for production.

10. **File Storage Strategy**: Storing evidence files in a local filesystem directory with database metadata references.

11. **Authentication Approach**: Using Flask-Login with custom MFA implementation (TOTP) rather than a third-party auth provider.

12. **UI Framework**: Utilizing Bootstrap for responsive design across desktop and mobile devices.

13. **Deployment Strategy**: Containerized deployment with Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

14. **Rate Limiting Backend**: Using Redis for persistent storage of rate limiting data across application restarts.
